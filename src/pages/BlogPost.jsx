        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Core Analysis</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Autumn presses the air thin and cool; Metal is in season and Fire feels small. <em>Di Tian Sui</em> puts it simply: "Ding fire thrives with Wood and is cut by Metal." That single line is the key. This fire isn't flamboyant; it brightens when it has Wood—structure, growth, breath.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          In this chart Metal and Water are strong; Wood and Fire are weak. In life that often reads as: rules feel heavy, feedback feels loud, and the person hesitates to step forward. The hour stem shows Geng (Wealth) out in the open—opportunity is visible—yet the daymaster is too light to carry it steadily. So the issue isn't fate; it's sequence: <strong>build Wood → kindle Fire → then take Metal/Water on your terms</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">What does "Wood then Fire" look like in real life?</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Wood is rhythm and growth:</strong> earlier nights, a little morning light, one course or certification each quarter, and boundaries written in clear sentences. <strong>Fire is expression and action:</strong> a visible demo once a month, a brief training, a document that non-tech teammates can use. When Wood feeds Fire, Metal stops cutting you and becomes the tool in your hand.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Work that fits that arc</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Choose roles where you turn complexity into something usable: <strong>photonics/optics, solar & storage, power electronics and control, or applied ML tied to product</strong>. These paths let you collaborate—PMs, front-end, customers, trainees—so your Fire isn't just screen-deep. Pure compliance, pure simulation, or closed-door research isn't off-limits, but bolt on a Wood-Fire module: demos, docs, training, visualization, design reviews.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Money, without the whiplash</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          With Geng Wealth exposed, money shows up, but a weak daymaster can't sprint after every project. Translate that into strategy: turn one-off wins into repeatable offers, favor milestone billing and subscriptions, and keep leverage low. On the timeline, <strong>2026–2027 looks like a clean rise in income</strong>; in <strong>2028–2029, opportunities multiply but collections and payment terms deserve sharper attention</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">People and boundaries</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Strong Metal/Water with faint Wood often feels like over-attunement to feedback, people-pleasing, and rumination after the fact. Don't call it "selfish"—call it healthy boundaries: <strong>three non-negotiables</strong> (no midnight rescues; no unsecured lending; zero tolerance for emotional blackmail), <strong>two needs that must be seen</strong> (quiet time, reply windows), and a <strong>daily cap on social output</strong>. Many "energy drains" are just doors left open too long.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Space and small rituals</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          A tiny, windowless office? Sit with your back to a solid wall, keep the door in view at a slight angle, hang a nature landscape as a "window," and use warm 2700–3000K light. If you like talismans, one piece is enough: <strong>green Hetian jade on a red cord—Wood + Fire in a single token</strong>. It's not magic; it's a reminder to keep growth and expression on the calendar.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Path Forward</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          He asked how to "cultivate Wood." The answer is unromantic and effective: <strong>make learning a rhythm, make expression a habit, make boundaries a norm</strong>. Do that, and the Ding Fire stops being "weak" and becomes steady. When the flame holds, Metal and Water cooperate: the knife cuts clean; the stream turns the wheel.
        </p>

            For this Baguio chart, the path condenses to eight characters: <strong>"Build Wood, kindle Fire; bear Wealth, walk steady."</strong> May that be the shape of his next few years.

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          I remember a road from long ago. Evening had cooled the city like a slab of iron, and I was running after someone's back. The wind tugged at my hair and at my breath until both hurt. I thought love meant acceleration—that if I ran fast enough, we would end up side by side.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Then the light turned red. I stopped and found my hands empty, my chest emptier. So much effort, and I had misplaced myself halfway.

          <p class="text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
            Later I learned: the right person is not the one you have to chase. He slows when you can't keep pace. When it rains, he doesn't stage a heroic dash through the storm; he simply tilts the umbrella toward your side.

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          You say, "I'm not doing great today," and he doesn't start a lecture or force a quick recovery. He just sits with you a while. The silence is like a cup of warm water—ordinary, but it holds heat.

            <p class="text-mystic-200 mb-3">
              The right person remembers the small pulse of life. The tap-tap on the cutting board, the button on your shirt that's always loose, the medicine you fumble for at two a.m.

          </div>

            <p class="text-mystic-200 mb-3">
              He doesn't lift you out of the world; when the world gets too loud, he turns the volume down. You say, "I'm scared." He doesn't laugh, and he doesn't promise forever.
            </p>

              I picture an ordinary night. You sit on the kitchen floor while it rains outside. Only the stove light is on. You tell the story of your mess of a day; he offers no verdict, just splits the last orange and gives you the sweeter slice.

              Your chest loosens. The bills are still due, tomorrow still uncertain, but the small, nervous animal inside you closes its eyes. You aren't rescued; you are seen. You aren't pulled; you are caught.

          So don't break yourself into a beam of light to chase a brighter one. We're human—we get tired, we get scared, we hesitate. The right person is the one who reaches out when you're shaking, who leaves the door open a crack when you want to run, who says, "Then let's go slow," and means it.
        </p>

          <p class="text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
            Learn to notice what lasts: behind warm gestures, look for patience; behind pretty words, look for the one who returns. May you meet someone who will make life detailed with you. And may you become that someone—unshowy, unspectacular, but reliable, quiet, warm.

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          In recent headlines, ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has intensified its immigration sweeps, echoing a global wave of enforcement and "clearing the field." Interestingly, from the lens of Chinese metaphysics — specifically BaZi — this is more than just politics; it's part of a larger energetic pattern.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          2025 is the Year of Yi-Si (乙巳) in the Chinese calendar. The interaction of Si Fire (巳火) and Shen Metal (申金) later in the year creates what we call a Fire–Metal Clash. This clash is traditionally associated with purging and removal of harmful or unstable elements.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Cosmic Pattern Behind Global Events</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          From Mexico's expulsion of cartel leaders to ICE's tightening immigration actions, these events reflect the same cosmic theme: removing instability to restore order. The Fire-Metal clash manifests as:

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          When people come to me for a BaZi reading, one of the most common questions is: "Will I be rich? And how much money can I make?"
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          In BaZi, figuring out your wealth level is a bit like checking your money bag—how big it is, whether it can hold money, and if it will leak. We look at all these factors together.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Step 1: Find Your "Wealth Star"</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          In BaZi, the Wealth Star represents money. For different people, money belongs to different elements, just like different bags hold different things:

            <p class="text-mystic-200 mb-3">
              For some, <strong>Earth is money</strong> (e.g., people born on a Jia Wood day). These individuals find wealth through stability, real estate, and practical investments.
            </p>

            <p class="text-mystic-200 mb-3">
              For others, <strong>Metal is money</strong> (e.g., people born on a Bing Fire day). These people excel in finance, technology, and precision-based wealth building.

            <p class="text-mystic-200 mb-3">
              For others, <strong>Water is money</strong> (e.g., people born on a Wu Earth day). These individuals find wealth through communication, travel, and fluid opportunities.

          <p class="text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
            First, find out which element is your "money," so you can see if your chart has a good money bag. This is determined by your Day Master element and follows specific BaZi rules.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Step 2: Check if the Bag Is Strong</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          The "Day Master" in BaZi represents you. If you're strong, you can carry a big bag and keep the money safe; if you're weak, a heavy bag will tire you out and may even leak.

              <strong>Can handle and keep money.</strong> You have the capacity to manage large sums, make wise investments, and maintain wealth over time. Your money bag is sturdy and reliable.

            <p class="text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Too much money becomes a burden, and it's harder to save.</strong> You may experience money coming in quickly but also leaving just as fast. Focus on building your capacity first.

            Reading wealth in BaZi isn't about stamping you as "rich" or "poor" for life. It's about helping you find the right timing and method to grow your money. Knowing when to push and when to hold back ensures your wealth grows steadily — instead of coming fast and disappearing just as quickly.

          Your chart reveals a financial path marked by steady accumulation rather than overnight windfalls. 
          Wealth opportunities in your life tend to come through consistent effort, professional skill, and strategic partnerships 
          rather than speculative ventures. This is a chart that values foundation before expansion — if you set up the structure well, 
          the wealth will naturally flow in.

          BaZi gives you the "inborn color palette," MBTI reveals your "usage habits." Put the map and the manual together, and you get a fuller picture of yourself.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">1. BaZi: The Inborn Base Tone</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          In BaZi, your year, month, day, and hour form the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. The Five Elements shape the base of your personality:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Wood</strong>: Growth, vision, planning, restless to change.</li>
          <li><strong>Fire</strong>: Warmth, expressiveness, quick action.</li>
          <li><strong>Earth</strong>: Steady, orderly, security-oriented, slow to warm up but long-lasting.</li>
          <li><strong>Metal</strong>: Decisive, rule-focused, efficient, sometimes stubborn.</li>
          <li><strong>Water</strong>: Flexible, observant, adaptable, creative, but can be changeable.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">2. MBTI: Your Habitual Operating Mode</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          MBTI uses four dimensions—E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P—to describe your preferences in perceiving the world and making decisions. It's not a fixed label, but a behavioral tendency.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">3. Common Patterns Between Five Elements & MBTI</h2>
        <ul class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Strong Wood/Fire → often higher in E, N, F, P</li>
          <li>Strong Earth/Metal → often higher in I, S, T, J</li>
          <li>Strong Metal/Water → more likely T (Thinking)</li>
          <li>Strong Wood/Fire → more likely F (Feeling)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed italic">
          <em>Note: These are patterns, not strict rules.</em>
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">4. Two Quick Examples</h2>
        <ul class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Fire + Metal strong, Wood + Water weak</strong> → Often ENTJ: outward-driving, rule-and-results focused, strategic and execution-oriented.</li>
          <li><strong>Water + Wood strong, Earth + Fire weak</strong> → Often INFP: idealistic, values-driven, creative but needs more structure to execute.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">5. How to Combine the Two</h2>
        <ul class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>BaZi shows your natural element balance and what you need more or less of.</li>
          <li>MBTI shows your habitual communication, decision-making, and work style.</li>
          <li>Together, they answer: where your talents are, how you use them, and how to fill the gaps.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">6. Applications</h2>
        <ul class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Career</strong>: BaZi defines the direction (element preferences), MBTI chooses the work style and team fit.</li>
          <li><strong>Relationships</strong>: BaZi shows the type of people you attract, MBTI helps you adjust your communication style.</li>
          <li><strong>Growth</strong>: BaZi fills elemental gaps, MBTI fine-tunes functional preferences for lasting habits.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Closing</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          BaZi is the map; MBTI is the manual. Put them together, and you're more likely to walk the right road—and walk it steadily.

      excerpt: "Discover the unique challenges and opportunities in this BaZi chart analysis. Learn how pressure transforms into momentum and when the breakthrough years arrive for this winter-born Geng Metal woman.",
      content: `
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          On January 17, 1984, at 2 a.m., a baby girl was born in the deep cold of mid-winter. It was the lunar Chou month, when the earth is still frozen and the chill is heavy in the air. Her BaZi chart reads: Gui Hai, Yi Chou, Geng Xu, Wu Yin. Just from these four pillars, you can already sense the vibe — capable, but often having to push forward under outside pressure.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Chart Structure</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Born as Geng Metal in Chou month, she's like ore buried deep in winter soil — strong and solid, but needing the warmth of fire to truly shine. In her chart, Gui Water in the year pillar is strong, forming a Qi Sha (Seven Killings) structure, meaning her life won't lack challenges — superiors, rules, and circumstances will all put her to the test.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Elemental Analysis</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Yi Wood in the month stem is the Wealth star, but it's held down by cold, heavy Earth, so financial luck goes up and down. Fortunately, Wu Earth in the hour stem acts as an Indirect Resource, helping to shield her from some of the pressure, though not with overwhelming strength. The Yin Wood in the hour branch hides Bing Fire — a little spark of warmth — but in winter it's faint, and needs careful nurturing.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Strengths and Challenges</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          With this setup, her strengths are responsibility and not shying away from hard work. The drawback is that she often moves because she has to, not because she wants to. At work, she's often in environments with high standards and demanding bosses; she can make money, but expenses and responsibilities grow at the same pace, so saving is tough.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Relationship Dynamics</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          In relationships, she may be drawn to partners who are powerful but controlling, which can leave her feeling passive. Physically, her cold-damp constitution can cause issues like weak digestion, lower back and kidney sensitivity, and cold hands and feet.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Root Cause and Solutions</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          The root of these issues is clear: water is too strong, fire too weak. Strong water means more pressure, weak fire means less sustained drive and warmth. The fix is simple in concept — warm up first, then stabilize. That means getting more sunlight, doing activities that make her sweat, wearing warm colors like red, orange, and beige, and avoiding too much cool-toned clothing.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Practical Recommendations</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          At home or work, face southeast or south if possible, and add green plants or warm-toned décor. In diet, favor warming foods like ginger tea, red dates, yam, and pumpkin; cut back on iced or cold items, especially in winter.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Career Guidance</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Career-wise, she's better suited to Earth- and Fire-related fields such as management, planning, training, consulting, or education. These roles let her use her organizational skills while reducing the oppressive feel of heavy Metal-Water environments. If staying in her current industry, she should try to shift toward strategic or managerial roles to gain more decision-making power.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Relationship and Financial Advice</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          In relationships, it's important not to give up her identity just to keep the peace. She should choose partners who respect her independence. For finances, she needs to get used to saving before spending, and ideally, develop multiple income streams so pressure isn't all on one job.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Future Outlook</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Looking ahead, 2025 (Yi Si year) brings more visible opportunities as fire starts to emerge, but she should be mindful of interpersonal friction. 2026 (Bing Wu year) is a rare high-energy year — an ideal time for breakthroughs in both career and love. 2027 (Ding Wei year) is about consolidating gains and turning recent wins into long-term stability.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          In short, this chart describes someone who's never short of challenges — or ability. Once she learns to warm herself up and stabilize her footing, pressure turns into momentum. And 2026? That's the year she can break past her limits and start a whole new chapter. When that time comes, the ore in the cold earth will finally glitter in the sunlight.

          BaZi, also known as the Four Pillars of Destiny, is one of the most profound systems in Chinese astrology. 
          It's based on the principle that the time of your birth contains the blueprint of your entire life journey.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">What is BaZi?</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          BaZi literally means "Eight Characters" in Chinese. These characters represent the year, month, day, and hour 
          of your birth, each expressed in terms of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Four Pillars</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Each pillar consists of two characters: a Heavenly Stem (天干) and an Earthly Branch (地支). 
          The Heavenly Stems represent the active, yang energy, while the Earthly Branches represent the 
          passive, yin energy.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Understanding Your Chart</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Your BaZi chart reveals your inherent personality traits, strengths, weaknesses, and the timing 
          of significant life events. It's like having a detailed map of your destiny.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Five Elements</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Each Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch corresponds to one of the Five Elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, 
          Metal, and Water. The balance and interaction of these elements in your chart determine your 
          personality and life path.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Practical Applications</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Understanding your BaZi can help you make better decisions about career choices, relationships, 
          timing for important decisions, and personal development.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Getting Started</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          The best way to begin your BaZi journey is to get a professional reading. An expert can help you 
          understand your chart and provide guidance on how to work with your destiny rather than against it.

        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          The best relationships often occur between elements that support each other. For example, 
          Water nourishes Wood, Wood feeds Fire, Fire creates Earth, Earth produces Metal, and 
          Metal collects Water. Understanding these cycles can help you identify compatible partners.

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Talismans have been used for thousands of years in Chinese culture to provide protection, 
          attract good fortune, and create positive energy. These ancient tools are as relevant today 
          as they were in ancient times, offering modern people spiritual support in an increasingly complex world.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">What Are Talismans?</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Talismans are sacred objects inscribed with symbols, characters, or designs that carry 
          specific spiritual power. They can be made from various materials including paper, metal, 
          stone, or cloth, and are often personalized to the individual's needs and energy.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Types of Protection Talismans</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          There are many types of talismans, each serving different purposes. Some provide general 
          protection, others ward off specific negative energies, and some attract particular types 
          of good fortune. The most common include health protection, wealth attraction, and relationship harmony.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">How Talismans Work</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Talismans work through the principle of energy resonance. The symbols and materials used 
          create a specific vibrational frequency that interacts with your personal energy field. 
          This interaction can strengthen positive energies and weaken negative ones.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Personalized Talismans</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          The most effective talismans are those created specifically for you. A skilled practitioner 
          will analyze your BaZi chart to understand your energy needs and create a talisman that 
          addresses your specific challenges and goals.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Activation and Maintenance</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Talismans must be properly activated to work effectively. This usually involves a ritual 
          that connects the talisman to your personal energy. Regular maintenance, including cleansing 
          and recharging, ensures the talisman continues to work at optimal levels.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Modern Applications</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Today, talismans can be used in many ways. Some people carry them for daily protection, 
          others place them in their homes or workplaces, and some use them during meditation or 
          spiritual practices. They can be particularly helpful during challenging times or transitions.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Choosing the Right Talisman</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          When choosing a talisman, consider your current needs and challenges. A professional 
          consultation can help you identify the most appropriate type and ensure it's properly 
          created and activated for your specific situation.

          Personality analysis has fascinated humans for centuries, leading to the development of

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The MBTI Approach</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          MBTI is based on Carl Jung's theory of psychological types and focuses on how you prefer 
          to perceive the world and make decisions. It categorizes people into 16 personality types 
          based on four dichotomies: Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, 
          and Judging/Perceiving.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Philosophical Differences</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          BaZi is deterministic, suggesting that your personality and life path are largely predetermined 
          by birth timing. MBTI is more flexible, suggesting that while you have natural preferences, 
          you can develop different aspects of your personality throughout your life.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Time and Change</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          BaZi shows how your personality and opportunities change over time through luck pillars. 
          MBTI suggests that your core type remains relatively stable, though you can develop 
          different functions and become more balanced.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Practical Applications</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          BaZi is excellent for understanding life timing, career choices, and long-term planning. 
          MBTI is better for understanding communication styles, work preferences, and interpersonal 
          relationships in the present moment.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Integration Benefits</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Using both systems together provides a more complete picture of your personality. BaZi 
          shows your destiny and timing, while MBTI shows your current preferences and how to work 
          with them. This combination offers both long-term guidance and immediate practical advice.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Choosing Your Approach</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          If you're interested in life planning and destiny, start with BaZi. If you want to 
          understand your current personality and improve relationships, begin with MBTI. For the 
          most comprehensive understanding, explore both systems and see how they complement each other.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Future of Personality Analysis</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          As we move forward, the integration of ancient wisdom with modern psychology will become 
          increasingly valuable. Both BaZi and MBTI offer unique perspectives that, when combined, 
          provide a more complete understanding of human nature and potential.

          In Chinese astrology, the season of your birth plays a crucial role in shaping your 
          personality and life path. Each season brings different elemental energies that influence 
          your natural talents, challenges, and the way you navigate life's journey.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Spring Births (February-May)</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Spring births are dominated by Wood energy, representing growth, expansion, and new beginnings. 
          Spring people are naturally optimistic, ambitious, and always looking forward. They excel 
          at starting new projects and inspiring others with their vision.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Summer Births (May-August)</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Summer births carry strong Fire energy, representing passion, creativity, and transformation. 
          Summer people are charismatic, expressive, and bring warmth to any situation. They excel 
          at leadership and creative endeavors that require enthusiasm and energy.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Autumn Births (August-November)</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Autumn births are characterized by Metal energy, representing precision, clarity, and harvest. 
          Autumn people are organized, principled, and excellent at bringing projects to completion. 
          They value quality and have a natural ability to refine and perfect.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Winter births carry Water energy, representing wisdom, depth, and reflection. Winter people 
          are intuitive, thoughtful, and excellent at strategic planning. They excel at research, 
          analysis, and understanding complex systems.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Seasonal Challenges</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Each season also brings specific challenges. Spring people may struggle with patience and 
          follow-through. Summer people might have difficulty with consistency and focus. Autumn 
          people can be too rigid and perfectionistic. Winter people may struggle with taking action 
          and being visible.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Working with Seasonal Energy</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Understanding your seasonal energy helps you work with your natural strengths rather than 
          against them. Spring people should focus on growth and expansion. Summer people should 
          channel their passion into creative projects. Autumn people should focus on completion 
          and refinement. Winter people should use their wisdom for strategic planning.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          Seasonal energy also influences compatibility in relationships and partnerships. Some 
          seasonal combinations create natural harmony, while others require more work to balance. 
          Understanding these dynamics can help you build stronger relationships.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Leveraging Your Seasonal Strengths</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 text-mystic-200 leading-relaxed">
          To maximize your potential, align your activities with your seasonal energy. Spring people 
          should take on new challenges and leadership roles. Summer people should focus on creative 
          expression and inspiring others. Autumn people should work on completing projects and 
          building systems. Winter people should focus on research, planning, and strategic thinking.
